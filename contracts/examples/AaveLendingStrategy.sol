 * @title AaveLendingStrategy

 *      and returning those rewards to the Farm contract.
 *
 * Note: In a real implementation, the contract would interact with Aave's WETHGateway
 * and LendingPool contracts to deposit and withdraw ETH. Here, for demonstration, we simulate
 * the deposit and reward accrual.
